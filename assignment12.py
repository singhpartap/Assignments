#QUESTION:1
#SOLUTION:
#The Access Token is a credential that can be used by an application to access an API.
#It can be any type of token (such as an opaque string or a JWT) and is meant for an API. 
#Its purpose is to inform the API that the bearer of this token has been authorized to access the API and 
#perform specific actions (as specified by the scope that has been granted).
#The Access Token should be used as a Bearer credential and transmitted in an HTTP Authorization header to the API.

#QUESTION:4 What is a difference between library and API . Figure it out with examples.
#SOLUTION:
# API is a part of library which defines how an application communicates with external code
# .
# API can be written in any language.
# Library is written in same language which is a collection of all the functionalities required for the use case.

# For example : Numpy is a library of Python, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, 
# along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

# We can create our own APIs using Python Framework like Django and Flask which can be used in websites.
# You can follow documentation of Django in order to create your own website with Python.
